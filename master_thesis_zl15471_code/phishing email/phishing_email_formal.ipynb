Instead of keeping the money in an illicit home, he chose to deposit it in a Libyan bank without proper explanation. This decision had severe consequences, as some believed the money was still in our mansion, leading to a violent search and the unfortunate death of my younger brother. Fearing for our lives, my mother and I fled, eventually finding refuge in Burkina Faso, where I established contact with a consultancy firm, after my late father had diplomatically moved the funds to a European financial institution, designating me as the beneficiary.\""

The implications are that either the bank's board of directors might gain access to these funds, which could eventually be classified as dormant and seized by the government's treasury during the forthcoming audit by national auditors. To prevent this outcome, I urgently need to remit the funds. It is my belief that the government's treasury will confiscate the funds if not claimed, and considering that individuals like you and I are involved, it is imperative that we act to secure these funds. The account belongs to the late Dr. B. D. Redo, a foreign miner associated with Kruger Gold Co and a professional geologist, who has since passed away. Nobody else has any knowledge of this account or its contents, and my investigation has confirmed that the company is unaware of its existence. The total amount involved is $10.5 million USD.\""

I am Nicholas Mavis, the son of the late Mavis Radcic. My father was a prosperous cocoa merchant in Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast. Unfortunately, my father was poisoned to death by his business associates during an outing on the first day of January while celebrating the New Year. Tragedy further struck as my mother passed away when I was still an infant. My father had taken special care of me before his demise. On his deathbed in January, within a private hospital in Abidjan, he confided in me about a sum of $12 million USD that he had discreetly left in a suspense account at a prime bank in Abidjan. He used my name as his son and next of kin to deposit these funds. He also expressed his wish for me to find a trustworthy foreign partner who could assist in moving these funds abroad for investment purposes.\""
