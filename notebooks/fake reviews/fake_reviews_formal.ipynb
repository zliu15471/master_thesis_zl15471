The clean cuts it delivers are impressive, and I find myself using it on numerous projects. Recently, I decided to purchase a new one and used it to cut with a saw I've had for about a year now. The Skeletool's build quality is excellent, but it is quite heavy, which can be a bit challenging on my workbench. However, I've still grown fond of it. One minor issue I've encountered is that it doesn't work as effectively when pushing the handle back against the base. Nonetheless, I'm generally satisfied with its performance and reliability.\""
